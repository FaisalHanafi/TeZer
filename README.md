# TeZer
A simple English-based article text summarizer

# Introduction
A project for the CSCI 4342 class on natural language processing was done by me (Faisal) and Syazmi under the tutelage of Dr. Suriani of IIUM's KICT. In this project, we demonstrate how to use the Spacy library and extractive summarization to address the issue of multi-document summarization.

# Instruction
1. To utilise the system, the user just needs to open the Python source code and paste their article into a variable.
2. Then the system will generate the prediction based on the percentage of the original length that had been set, which is defaulted at 40%.
3. To change this, the user just needs to change the variable select_length.
Reminder: The difference in length between the summarised article and the original will greatly affect the accuracy.

# Future
A better prediction module.
